# Capstone Project IV - Create a Webpage With HTML and CSS.

A project to demonstrate my progress in the HyperionDev bootcamp. Using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap a website was developed in accordance with the task to 
have images, lists, paragraphs, tables, multiple pages, a testimonial and form buttons.

In terms of functionality it is fairly simple there are links at the top/bottom of the screen that allow movement between the html pages with additional links on the index.html to the about and collections page. The website is fully responsive so can be seen on any device.
